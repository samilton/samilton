<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>

<p>The Max Performance Harvest Triathlon in Wareham, MA was very well run race in a beautiful town at the base of Cape Cod. It featured a straight-forward lake swim, a bike course that was longer than most Intermediate distance triathlons at 29 miles, and a challenging run. I&rsquo;ll talk more those experiencesand my performance later.</p>

<p>I arrived on Friday to take care of packet pick-up and get checked into the hotel. The day got a bit later start than I had hoped but timing was fine. The race was very small and packet pick up was no problem at all. After packet pick up I walked the transition area to better understand the location of the swim in, bike out/in, and run out relative to where by bike would be racked.</p>

<p>The morning of the race went as smoothly as possible. I arrived a bit earlier than normal to deal with parking and racking the bike but overall there was probably no need. The transition area was small and a bit chaotic (no assigned bike positions just assigned rows.) This left me with plenty of time to get a short warm up swim in and make sure the wet suit was on properly. This was actually the first mistake of the day. The swim practice was from 0600-0630 and a race start at 0730. My mistake was getting in the water too soonand I would feel it on the first stretch of the swim.</p>

<p>Other than that it was a smooth morning with a fantastic national anthem song by someone local.</p>

<h3 id="swim">Swim</h3>

<p>The hardest part of the swim was the walk from transition to the water. The walk was over a gravel covered levy which most of made the mistake of walking across barefooted. It was not fun. There was a bit of an additional lag as we waited for the waves ahead of us but the crowd was pumped and having fun.</p>

<p>The swim was in an water start, which gave me the opportunity to find a quiet spot away from the crowds. As the gun went off there were only 4-5 people in my immediate area. This made the start of the swim far less stressful. I immediately felt great on the swim and followed my coaches advice to push the pace. The course was well marked and I was able to swim a farely straight line with regular sighting (a first for me). As I made the final turn, I knew that I had had a great swim but I began to be a bit concerned by my heart rate. It felt a bit high and sure enough once I exited the water my feelings were right. I was pushing 160 BPM. Overall, the swim was fantastic and I set a PR for an olympic distance swim.</p>

<h3 id="t1">T1</h3>

<p>My swim to bike transition is always a bit slower. While this can be attributed to the removal of the wet suit, etc. I also tend to have a short dizzy sspell from time-to-time. While this occured this time I was well prepared for it and was able to continue preparing for the ride and work through it. I had a reasonable but not great transition at 2:01.</p>

<h3 id="bike">Bike</h3>

<p>The bike was a challenging beast in a number of ways. First and foremost, it was not hilly by any stretch but it was rolling and very windy in stretches. Early on in the bike I really struggled to find my rhythm. I think I focused to heavily on trying to get my HR to recover and as a result my brain went everywhere.</p>

<p>The first 8-9 miles were some of the hardest mental miles I&rsquo;ve ever done at this distance. No matter what I did either my brain or the wind was fighting me and sometimes both. At about the 11 mile mark the wind started dying down and my the fog in my head started to clear. From there, with 18 miles remaining of beautiful and relatively quiet roads I was able to find a zone and push through the miles pretty quickly. At some point around mile 15 or 16 I had a squirrel dart between my front and back wheel. Unfortunately for the little guy he didn&rsquo;t make but I managed to stay upright on the bike and finish the 29 miles in a respectable 1:21</p>

<h3 id="t2">T2</h3>

<p>T2 went really well. Jamie was waiting for me right as I came off the bike and seeing her smile reenvirograted me in a way only she can. I was able to make my to my area without issue and be done with T2 in 1:21. This is an average T2 for me.</p>

<h3 id="run">Run</h3>

<p>The run was misery from the start. It was clear that I hadn&rsquo;t taken my nutrition seriously enough on the bike. While I was able to put down a reasonable time it was no where near my best. By mile 2 I was thinking &ldquo;Walk, just walk, the pain will stop&rdquo;. Despite the constant chatter I refused to let myself stop and continued to slip and slide through the next 4 miles of sand and loosely packed dirt. Even at 100% the run would have been a challenge but in my compromised state, it was clear that it was going to be slog.</p>

<p>I managed a fairly surprising 07:49/mile average and ended with a strong finish and a debilitating cramp that surely would have ended my day if the finish line hadn&rsquo;t done so first.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>This was a great benchmark race for me for a number of reasons. The stated goal of the day was to qualify for Age Group National Championships and I was able to do that with a 2nd place finish in my age group. More importantly I taught myself a lesson that would bay dividends just one week later at the Pat Griskus Triathlon. I wear a tri suit from Love the Pain and it says in two spots on the kit &ldquo;Love the Pain&rdquo;. I often get comments asking if I really love the pain. To be honest, most of the answer is no. No one loves pain. However in this moment I appreciated what the saying meant and proved to myself that I could silence the negative chatter and finish the goal.</p>
