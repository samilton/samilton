<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>

<p>This race replaced the Rev3 Quassy Olympic on my race calendar and boy was it a fun race. The energy amongst the athletes was more friendly than any other race I&rsquo;d ever done. The organizers, volunteers, and athletes were all on the same page and it showed. Thanks for a great race and I can wait to return next year.</p>

<h3 id="swim">Swim</h3>

<p>The swim was definitely longer than the typical Olympic course. Of course, I had trouble sighting as it was the first time I had ever done a diamond shaped swim and it was difficult making the turn at the top of the diamond. Needless to say, I swam a respectable pace at 1:<sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> over 2000 yards. I felt good on the swim but not as good as I had felt the previous week at the Harvest triathlon. I have a feeling that was due to the trouble sighting that I also seem to have on this particular lake. Despite the difficulty, I was happy with the effort.</p>

<h3 id="t1">T1</h3>

<p>There was a longish run from the swim exit to the transition area but I was able to jog it and put in a reasonable 2:46 pace. I stumbled a bit with the wet suit and I also choose not to do a flying mount due to the quality of the tarmac in the transition area (it was bad).</p>

<h3 id="bike">Bike</h3>

<p>The bike went much better than last week and I felt comfortable almost immediately. I have a feeling that this was partly due to some familiriaty with the beginning of the course. I found my rhythm and started cranking when I was immediately met with a climb that felt like it lasted forever. By my estimation we were climbing from mile 8 all the way through to 12.5. It then turned into a bit of a rolling course. This allowed me to settle back in and enjoy the remaining 12 miles of the race. Overall, I was happy with my effort and while my power output was a little low, I felt that this was a much more solid ride than the previous week. I was able to focus more on nutrition/hydration which soon be obvious on the run. The only big note I have on the bike is that I need to work on my descending skills. I definitely gave time and places due to a bit of over cautiousness when descending.</p>

<h3 id="t2">T2</h3>

<p>T2 went the best it could have gone. My transition spot was well laid out and I was in and out in 1:37 seconds. Which wasn&rsquo;t my fastest but definitely not my slowest T2.</p>

<h3 id="run">Run</h3>

<p>The run was brilliant. The course has a reputation of being difficult due to the amount of climbing but I felt great and was able to really push the pace. I started out a hot on the downhill out of transition and pushed a 7:06 first mile. The first 1.5 miles out to the first turn around went well and I felt great the whole way. A big part of this was having a chance to fall in with another athlete that was running at my pace. We ended up finishing the run together. On the way back the pace slowed a bit due to the climb but we were able to still turn out a sub 7:30/mile. Then it was a rinse and repeat on the second loop with almost identical results. Overall, while I was gassed at the end this was easily the best olympic run I have ever completed.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>It was a dream to come across the finish line and see the clock under 02:30:00 hours. Just the previous week Jamie and I had joked that it would be a challenge to find the 6 minutes needed to make that possible. Fortunately, despite a longer than expected swim I was able to push the pace on the bike and then really push it on the run. This allowed for what once seemed out of reach to be a reality.</p>

<p>On to USAT Nationals in Cleveland!</p>
